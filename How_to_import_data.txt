*THis file is a sample tutorial for importing the dataset into mongodb

step 1: Go to https://nycopendata.socrata.com/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/xx67-kt59/data to download dataset as CSV format. There is some problem with json file, so I use csv file. And the location of the data file is ~/Download/DOHMH_New_York_City_Restaurant_Inspection_Results.csv.

step 2: Start mongodb by typing:	
	sudo service mongod start

step 3: You can verify mongodb has started successfully by Verify that the mongod process has started successfully by checking the contents of the log file at /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log for a line reading:

	[initandlisten] waiting for connections on port <port>

step 4:	Just typping this to import dataset into mongodb:

	mongoimport --db weisheng --collection hygiene --type csv --headerline --file the location of csv file 
	
	This command means that, I import the csv file into a mongo db, the name of database is weisheng, the name of the collection (which is just like the table in mysql) is hygiene.

step 5. Then we can check the content of weisheng.hygiene by typping:
	use weisheng //switch database to weisheng

	then typping:
	db.hygiene.find() //can use to show the content of hygiene collection

step 6. you can type: 
	exit //to exit mongo shell, 
	then type:
	sudo service mongod stop // to stop mongodb
